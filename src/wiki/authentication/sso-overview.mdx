## What is SSO?

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.

## Our SSO Architecture

### Key Components

- Identity Provider (IdP)
- Service Providers (SPs)
- Authentication Protocols

## Authentication Flows

### SAML 2.0 Flow

1. User attempts to access an application
2. Application redirects to Identity Provider
3. User authenticates with IdP
4. IdP generates authentication assertion
5. User is redirected back to the application with valid credentials

### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Flow

1. User clicks "Login"
2. Redirected to centralized authentication server
3. Credentials validated
4. Access token and/or ID token issued
5. Application validates token

## Implemented Providers

- Okta
- Google Workspace

## Security Considerations

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Token Validation
- Session Management
- Credential Rotation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

# Implementation Details

## Supported Protocols

SSO leverages authentication protocols to enable secure communication between Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs). Two widely-used protocols are SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0** is an XML-based protocol that enables Single Sign-On (SSO) for web applications
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** is a modern authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0. It is lightweight, JSON-based, and designed for web, mobile, and API-driven applications

## Configuration Process

- **Identity Provider setup** - The IdP Metadata can be found on the ADSSO [Integration Guide page](https://adsso.sec.samsung.net/SSOPortal/Manual/ManualList).
- **Service Provider registration** - A step by step guide can be found on the Education Material slides that can be found on the ADSSO [Integration Guide page](https://adsso.sec.samsung.net/SSOPortal/Manual/ManualList).
- **Certificate** - The Certificate can be found on the ADSSO [Integration Guide page](https://adsso.sec.samsung.net/SSOPortal/Manual/ManualList).

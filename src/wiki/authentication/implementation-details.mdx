# Implementation Details

## Supported Protocols

SSO leverages authentication protocols to enable secure communication between Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs). Two widely-used protocols are SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

- **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0** is an XML-based protocol that enables Single Sign-On (SSO) for web applications
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** is a modern authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0. It is lightweight, JSON-based, and designed for web, mobile, and API-driven applications

## Configuration Process

- Identity Provider setup - point to metadata
- Service Provider registration - point to ppt
- Certificate management - point to certificate

## Local Development

- Setting up localhost:44369
